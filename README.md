Android App - early days yet.

So far:

- Crude SMS land or emergency cut off.
   - If android is aboard AR.Drone and the drone is out of Wi-Fi range, you can send an SMS txt message to the onboard phone to land the drone.
      - txt "`akko land`" to make the drone land.
      - txt "`akko kill`" to perform emergency motor kill.
